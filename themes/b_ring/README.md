A Hugo theme targeted at photographers and others who want to show
off some photos in the web. Galleries are created by just dropping
the photos in a folder and linking them in the content file. There
descriptions and titles can be specified.

The theme was built with fast load times in mind because most photography
portfolio websites are just soooooo slow. Images are optimized for display
(3 different versions are created) and lazily loaded everywhere.

The design is simple, focus on the photos!
